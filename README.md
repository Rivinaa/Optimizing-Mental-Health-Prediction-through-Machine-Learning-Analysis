# Optimizing-Mental-Health-Prediction-through-Machine-Learning-Analysis

This project critically examined ML models—Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost—to identify optimal methods for predicting mental health outcomes and supporting targeted interventions. Our analysis highlighted the impact of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors on mental well-being, with XGBoost emerging as the leading model for accuracy and robustness. This work advances predictive analytics for mental health, providing data-driven insights to enhance personalized care strategies.
